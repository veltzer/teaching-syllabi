# `Kafka` Internals

## Credits

## Description
The `Kafka` Internals training course is designed to teach students about the publish/subscribe messaging system with many advanced configurations. `Apache Kafka` is an open-source stream processing platform used to provide a unified, high-throughput, low-latency system for handling real-time data feeds from a wide range of source systems.

The course begins with covering configurations, allowing students to discover brokers, consumers, producers, and topics. Next, students will build their own `Kafka` clusters. The course will conclude by looking at applying their knowledge from the course to real-world scenarios like processing real-time stock price updates from an `API` and consolidating that into a data lake.

## Duration
16 hours / 2 days

## Intended Audience

## Objectives
* Understand the `Kafka` architecture and describe the roles and responsibilities of various Daemons
* Use producers, consumers, and brokers within `Kafka`
* Construct a streaming `ETL` pipeline using `Kafka` Connect

* Perform real-time analytics using KSQL

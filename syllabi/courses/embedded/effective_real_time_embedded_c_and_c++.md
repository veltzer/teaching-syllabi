# Effective Real Time Embedded C and C++

## Credits

## Description
Many software engineers work with C and C++ programming languages for real time and embedded
development. This course aims to give them a fuller appreciation of the more advanced aspects of the
languages in the real time and embedded environments.
Programming real time embedded systems make many special demands on the software engineer.
These include understanding compile, link and run-time issues, which are included in the course. It also
covers real time programming issues that are specific to the C and C++ languages.
Most of the course is relevant to both C and C++ software engineers, though some special points
relevant to C++ and object oriented are also presented.
The course is specifically aimed at issues relevant to real-time embedded software engineers.

## Duration
4 days / 32 hours

## Intended Audience
The course is designed for software engineers who want to improve their use of the C and / or C++
programming languages in a real time, embedded environment.

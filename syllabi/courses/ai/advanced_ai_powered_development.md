# Advanced `AI`-Powered Development

## Description
`AI`-powered development has rapidly evolved beyond simple code completion into a rich ecosystem of
agents, tools, skills, `MCP` servers, `RAG` pipelines, and autonomous coding workflows. Modern developers
must understand how to harness these capabilities to work effectively with large codebases, monoliths,
and complex systems. This course provides deep, hands-on coverage of the full `AI` development stack
as it exists today, from terminal-based `AI` coding agents to building custom `MCP` servers and
`RAG`-augmented development workflows.

The course is designed for experienced developers who already use basic `AI` assistance and want to
move to the next level: working with agentic tools, managing context in massive codebases, building
custom integrations, and understanding the architecture behind modern `AI` development infrastructure.

All topics reflect the state of the art as of early 2026, covering the latest tools, protocols, and
patterns that are actively used in production environments.

## Duration

# `AI` Agents Development

## Description
This two day course covers the design and implementation of autonomous `AI` agents powered by large language models. Students will learn to build agents that can reason, plan, use tools, and collaborate in multi-agent systems using modern frameworks such as `LangGraph`, `CrewAI`, and `AutoGen`. The course addresses agent memory, state management, evaluation strategies, guardrails, and production deployment.

## Duration
16 hours / 2 days

## Intended Audience
* Software developers building `AI`-powered applications
* Data engineers integrating `AI` agents into pipelines
* Software architects designing agent-based systems

## Prerequisites
* Proficiency in `Python` programming
* Basic understanding of `LLMs` and their APIs
* Familiarity with prompt engineering concepts

## Required Knowledge
* `Python` Programming (or equivalent experience)

## Objectives
* Understand the architecture and `design patterns` of `AI` agents.
* Build autonomous agents capable of reasoning, planning, and tool use.
* Implement multi-agent systems with coordination and communication.
* Apply guardrails and evaluation techniques to ensure agent reliability.
* Deploy agents to production environments.

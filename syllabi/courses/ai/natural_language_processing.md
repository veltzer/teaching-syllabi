# Natural Language Processing

## Description
This course is a comprehensive, language-agnostic treatment of `Natural Language Processing` from
foundations to modern transformer architectures. It covers the linguistic concepts that `make` text
processing hard, the classical algorithms that established the field, the statistical and neural
methods that revolutionized it, and the large-language-model era that defines its current shape.
Participants will study tokenization and morphology, classical and distributional semantics, syntactic
and dependency parsing, language models from `n`-grams to transformers, sequence labeling and tagging,
text classification and sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, machine translation, question
answering, summarization, dialogue systems, retrieval-augmented generation, evaluation methodology,
and the practical concerns of building NLP systems in production. The course emphasizes the *why*
behind each technique alongside the *how*, equipping participants to choose the right tool for the
problem and to understand new techniques as they emerge.

## Duration
64 hours / 8 days

## Intended Audience
* software developers building text-driven applications
* data scientists working with textual data
* `machine learning` engineers extending models to new domains
* technical leads evaluating NLP approaches and trade-offs
* researchers seeking a structured overview of the field

## Prerequisites
* `solid` programming experience in any modern language
* basic linear algebra (vectors, matrices, `dot` products)
* basic probability and statistics
* familiarity with `machine learning` fundamentals (training, loss, evaluation)
* exposure to `deep learning` concepts is helpful but not required

## Required Knowledge

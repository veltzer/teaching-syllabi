# Network Security

## Description
Network security is a critical discipline in today's interconnected world, where organizations face increasingly sophisticated threats targeting their network infrastructure. This course provides a comprehensive understanding of network security principles, technologies, and practices. Students will learn how to protect networks using firewalls, VPNs, encryption, and intrusion detection systems, as well as how to analyze traffic, respond to incidents, and design secure network architectures following modern zero trust principles.

## Duration
24 hours / 3 days

## Intended Audience
* Security professionals responsible for protecting network infrastructure
* System administrators managing firewalls, VPNs, and network devices
* Network engineers transitioning to security-focused roles
* IT professionals preparing for security certifications
* `DevOps` engineers implementing network security in cloud environments

## Prerequisites
* `Solid` understanding of `TCP`/`IP` networking fundamentals
* Familiarity with `Linux` and `Windows` command-line tools
* Basic understanding of network protocols (`HTTP`, `DNS`, `DHCP`)
* Experience with network device configuration (routers, switches)
* Understanding of basic cryptographic concepts is helpful

## Required Knowledge
* `Linux` Fundamentals (or equivalent experience)

## Objectives
* Understand `TCP`/`IP` security vulnerabilities and attack vectors
* Configure and manage firewalls including next-generation firewalls
* Deploy and manage `VPN` technologies (`IPSec`, `WireGuard`, `OpenVPN`)
* Implement `TLS`/`SSL` encryption and manage `PKI` infrastructure
* Secure `DNS` infrastructure using `DNSSEC`, `DoH`, and `DoT`
* Design and implement network segmentation and zero trust architectures
* Perform network traffic analysis using `Wireshark` and `tcpdump`
* Develop incident response procedures for network security events

# Cryptography Fundamentals

## Description
Cryptography is the foundation of modern information security. This course provides a comprehensive introduction to cryptographic concepts, algorithms, and protocols. Topics include symmetric and asymmetric encryption, hash functions, digital signatures, key exchange, `TLS`/`SSL`, `PKI`, password storage, and post-quantum cryptography. Participants will gain both theoretical understanding and practical experience using libraries such as `OpenSSL`, libsodium, and NaCl.

## Duration
24 hours / 3 days

* Software developers implementing security features
* Security engineers and analysts
* Backend developers working with authentication and encryption
* `DevOps` engineers managing certificates and secrets
* Anyone who needs to understand cryptography for their technical role

* Basic understanding of computer science fundamentals (binary, data structures)
* Familiarity with networking concepts (`TCP`/`IP`, `HTTP`/`HTTPS`)
* Basic knowledge of security concepts (confidentiality, integrity, authentication)
* Comfort with command-line tools

## Required Knowledge

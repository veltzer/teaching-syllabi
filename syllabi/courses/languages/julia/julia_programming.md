# Julia Programming

## Description
Julia is a high-level, high-performance programming language designed for technical computing.
It combines the ease of use of `Python` with the speed of `C`, making it ideal for scientific
computing, data science, and `machine learning`. This course covers Julia from its fundamentals
through advanced topics including its powerful type system, multiple dispatch, metaprogramming,
parallel and `GPU` computing, and the rich ecosystem of packages for data analysis and machine
learning. Students will learn to write performant, idiomatic Julia code and leverage the
language's unique strengths.
The course includes hands on exercises.

## Duration
32 hours / 4 days

## Intended Audience
* Developers looking to adopt a high-performance language for technical computing.
* Data scientists seeking a faster alternative to `Python` or `R`.
* Researchers and engineers working on numerical simulation, optimization, or `machine learning`.

## Prerequisites
* Programming experience in at least one language such as `Python`, `MATLAB`, `R`, or `C`.
* Basic understanding of linear algebra and statistics is helpful.
* Familiarity with command-line interfaces.

## Required Knowledge
* `Python` Programming (or equivalent experience)

## Objectives
* Write idiomatic and performant Julia code
* Leverage multiple dispatch and the type system effectively
* Use metaprogramming to generate efficient code
* Perform parallel and `GPU` computing in Julia
* Work with data using DataFrames.jl and visualization libraries
* Build `machine learning` models with `Flux`.jl
* Create and publish Julia packages

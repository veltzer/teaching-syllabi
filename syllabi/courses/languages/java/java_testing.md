# `Java` Testing

## Description
This course covers the full spectrum of testing in the `Java` ecosystem. From `JUnit 5` architecture and assertions through mocking with `Mockito`, integration testing with `Spring Boot` Test and `TestContainers`, to code coverage analysis with JaCoCo and mutation testing. Students will learn how to write effective, maintainable tests and adopt `TDD` as a development practice.

## Duration
16 hours / 2 days

## Intended Audience
* `Java` developers who want to improve their testing skills and code quality
* Software engineers adopting test-driven development practices
* Team leads seeking to establish testing standards in their teams

## Prerequisites
* Intermediate `Java` programming skills (classes, interfaces, generics, annotations)
* Basic understanding of object-oriented design principles
* Familiarity with a build tool such as `Maven` or `Gradle`
* Experience with an IDE such as `IntelliJ IDEA` or `Eclipse`

## Objectives
* Master the `JUnit 5` architecture and its extension model
* Write clear, maintainable unit tests with expressive assertions
* Use `Mockito` to isolate units under test with test doubles
* Implement integration tests using `Spring Boot` Test and `TestContainers`
* Measure and analyze test coverage with JaCoCo
* Apply `TDD` workflow to drive design and implementation
* Understand and apply mutation testing to evaluate test suite quality

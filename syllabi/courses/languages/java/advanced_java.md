# Advanced `Java`

## Description
This course teaches advanced concepts in `Java`. It teaches the more advanced aspects
of `Java` system. It covers important topics such as memory management, collections,
reflection, `JVM` internals, optimization, class loaders, references, NIO, multi-`threading`
and more.
The course will also present the most common pitfalls associated with the `JAVA` frameworks -
memory leaks, garbage collection issues, using `Java` in scenarios where it is not comfortable.

## Duration
40 hours / 5 days

## Intended Audience
* Experiences `Java` programmers who would like become experts in the `Java` landscape.
* `Java` operations people who would like to know how to tune the `JVM` or `find` issues
production `Java` systems.

## Prerequisites
* At least one year experience in programming `Java`.

## Objectives
* Participants will gain a better understanding of
    * how the `JVM` works.
    * how to use containers better.
    * how garbage collection works
    * the range of tools at their disposal
    `when` programming `Java` in order to protect themselves against multi-threaded race conditions.
    * the `Java` memory model
    * the `Java` compile time and run time optimizer

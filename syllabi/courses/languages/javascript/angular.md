# Angular Development

## Description
This course offers a thorough exploration of the Angular framework for building scalable, enterprise-grade web applications. Starting with Angular architecture and a `TypeScript` refresher, the course covers components, templates, data binding, directives, services, dependency injection, routing, forms, `HTTP` communication, `RxJS`, state management with NgRx, testing, and deployment. Students will gain the skills to build, test, and deploy production-ready Angular applications.

## Duration
32 hours / 4 days

## Intended Audience
* Frontend developers building enterprise-scale single-page applications
* `JavaScript` or `TypeScript` developers adopting the Angular framework
* Full-stack developers who need to build robust client-side applications
* Development teams migrating from AngularJS to modern Angular
* Software engineers working in organizations that use Angular as their primary frontend framework

## Prerequisites
* Good understanding of `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript` (`ES6`+ features)
* Basic knowledge of `TypeScript` (types, interfaces, classes, decorators)
* Familiarity with `npm` and command-line tools
* Understanding of `HTTP` protocol and `REST API` concepts
* Experience with basic web development and browser developer tools

## Required Knowledge
* `HTML` `CSS` `JavaScript` Fundamentals (or equivalent experience)
* `TypeScript` Programming (or equivalent experience)

## Objectives
* Understand Angular architecture, modules, and the component-based model
* Build components with templates, data binding, directives, and pipes
* Implement services and leverage Angular dependency injection system
* Configure client-side routing, navigation, guards, and resolvers
* Build reactive forms and template-driven forms with validation
* Communicate with backend services using HttpClient and interceptors
* Work with `RxJS` observables for reactive data handling
* Manage application state using NgRx
* Test Angular applications with Jasmine, Karma, and Cypress
* Optimize performance with lazy loading and production builds
* Style applications using `Angular Material`

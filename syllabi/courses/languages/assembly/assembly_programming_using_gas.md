# `Assembly` programming using gas

## Description
This comprehensive course on `Assembly` Programming on `Linux` using GAS (GNU Assembler) offers a deep dive into the world of low-level programming. Designed for both beginners and those with some programming experience,
the course takes students on a journey from the fundamentals of `assembly` language to advanced topics in system-level programming. Starting with an introduction to `assembly` concepts and the `x86`/`x86`-64 architectures, learners will quickly progress to writing and debugging their first `assembly` programs. The curriculum covers crucial areas such as data manipulation, arithmetic operations, control flow, and memory management, all within the context of the `Linux` operating system. Students will have gained practical experience in writing efficient `assembly` code, interfacing with C programs, and leveraging advanced features like SIMD instructions. With a strong emphasis on hands-on projects and real-world applications, this course equips participants with the skills needed to optimize performance-critical code, understand system internals, and even venture into areas like reverse engineering and low-level security analysis.

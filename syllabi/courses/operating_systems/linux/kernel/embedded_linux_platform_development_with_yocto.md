# Embedded `Linux` Platform Development with `Yocto`

## Credits
Mark Veltzer [mark.veltzer@gmail.com](mailto:mark.veltzer@gmail.com)

## Description
The `Yocto` Project has emerged as the industry standard for creating custom embedded `Linux` distributions, powering everything from `IoT` devices to automotive systems. This comprehensive course teaches participants how to leverage `Yocto`'s powerful build system to create maintainable, reproducible, and production-ready embedded `Linux` systems.

Unlike traditional approaches to embedded `Linux` development, `Yocto` provides a structured, metadata-driven framework that scales from single-board prototypes to complex multi-platform product lines. This course emphasizes practical, hands-on experience with modern `Yocto` workflows, including containerized builds, `CI/CD` integration, and security hardening.

Participants will learn not just how to use `Yocto`, but how to architect sustainable build systems that can evolve with their products over years of development and deployment.

## Duration
24 hours / 3 days
